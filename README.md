## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![](Capture.PNG)

Vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
Slope is not 0 because we have non-random variance of some variable.
Since r^2 is high, our model is fairly good at predicting MPG.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Overall, manufacturing meets design specifications, because our variance of 76psi is less than 100psi.

When grouped by lot, Lots 1 and 2 pass specifications with variances of 1psi and 10psi respectively. However, Lot 3 fails at variance 220psi.
